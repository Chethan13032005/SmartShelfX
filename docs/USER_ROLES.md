## Next steps (recommended)

1. Add a role→endpoint permission matrix (useful for RBAC enforcement).
2. Add a short security note for Admins about handling exported reports and credentials.
3. Create a dev-testing guide (MailHog, sample data, vendor stubs) to make local testing easier.

If you want, I can generate the role→endpoint mapping now or add the dev bcrypt helper to generate admin passwords locally.
